These are packages used by the LogScale SE team during POVs. They are not meant to be a replacement for the official LogScale [Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). However, feel free to use the content as necessary since they are meant to be learning examples. 

The packages generally include much more content than [individual dashboards, queries, alerts, etc](LogScale-and-FLTR/Vendor-Content). 

- **[crowdstrike-fltr-content](crowdstrike-fltr-content)**: queries and dashboards for Falcon telemetry, aka FDR. This must be installed with the [crowdstrike-fltr-run](crowdstrike-fltr-run) package.

- **[crowdstrike-fltr-run](crowdstrike-fltr-run)**: scheduled searches and user functions that act as the underpinning for the [crowdstrike-fltr-content](crowdstrike-fltr-content) package.

- **[crowdstrike-fltr-parser](crowdstrike-fltr-parser)**: a stand-alone parser for Falcon telemetry, aka FDR. You likely do not need this. 

- **[crowdstrike-fltr-identityprotection](crowdstrike-fltr-identityprotection)**: queries and dashboards for Falcon Identity Protection in LogScale. 

- **[crowdstrike-fltr-devicecontrol](crowdstrike-fltr-devicecontrol)**: dashboards for Falcon Device Control in LogScale.
