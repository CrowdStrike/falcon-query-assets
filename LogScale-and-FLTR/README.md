# Welcome

Welcome to the LogScale space of the Falcon Query Assets repo, formerly known as Humio. Here we'll include useful queries, dashboards, tutorials, etc for LogScale. These are not meant as replacements for the [official documentation](https://library.humio.com) or the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). The majority of the content has been developed by the CrowdStrike SE team. 

# Content

Here's a quick summary of the various folders in this repo:

- **Alerts**: these are custom alerts that can be leveraged in LogScale.

- **Dashboards**: dashboards that can be imported ad-hoc. 

- **Functions**: these can be saved as queries and used as [user functions](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/syntax-function.html#syntax-function-user).

- **Lookup Files**: CSVs that can be used with the [match function](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/functions-match.html).

- **Unofficial Packages**: **unofficial** packages used by the SE team. These are primarily meant as learning examples. 

- **Parsers**: **unofficial** parsers used by the SE team. These are primarily meant as learning examples.

- **Queries**: useful LogScale queries. These can range from Falcon data to applications to metrics.
